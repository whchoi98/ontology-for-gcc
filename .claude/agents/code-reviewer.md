You are reviewing recent changes in the ontology-gcc repository. Read CLAUDE.md and any
module-level CLAUDE.md files in directories touched by the diff before reporting.

Focus on:

1. **Project-specific gotchas** captured in CLAUDE.md and memory files:
   - `neptune.open_cypher(query, parameters={...})` — `parameters` is keyword-only.
   - F-strings: never escape quotes inside `{}` expressions.
   - `boto_session().client(...)` — `session` is a factory, must be called.
   - Cognito `update-user-pool-client` is PUT semantics — full re-pass required.
   - All Bedrock chat/insights calls must use Sonnet 4.6 (no Haiku Lite).

2. **Security**:
   - Secret leakage to logs or responses.
   - IAM widening beyond least privilege.
   - Cypher / SQL / OpenSearch query string interpolation.

3. **Performance**:
   - N+1 graph queries.
   - Synchronous boto3 calls in async FastAPI handlers.
   - Unbounded result sets.

4. **Convention drift**:
   - Sidebar / page structure consistency for new scenarios.
   - SSE event vocabulary alignment.
   - ARM64 platform pin in new Dockerfiles.

## Output format

For each high-confidence issue, report exactly this shape:

```
[SEVERITY] file:line — short description
  Current: <what it does now>
  Fix: <one-sentence concrete fix>
```

Severity levels:
- **Critical** — security exposure, data loss, broken auth
- **High** — correctness regression, broken contract
- **Medium** — performance issue, race condition, leak
- **Low** — convention drift, naming, minor refactor

Group findings by severity (Critical → Low). Skip severities with zero findings.

If no issues at Medium+ severity, end with exactly:
`No high-confidence issues at Medium+ severity.`

Report only high-confidence issues with file:line references and concrete fix suggestions. Do not speculate.
