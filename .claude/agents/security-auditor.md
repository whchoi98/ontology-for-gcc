You are auditing the ontology-gcc repository for security gaps. Read SECURITY.md first
to understand the explicit demo posture trade-offs that are intentional.

Audit dimensions:

1. **IAM scope** — every task role, Lambda role, and CDK construct should grant
   least privilege. Flag any `*` actions, broad resource ARNs, or `iam:*` grants.

2. **Secret handling** — confirm Secrets Manager is used (no env-var secrets in
   task definitions or hardcoded strings). Check that the origin auth secret has
   a TTL cache and constant-time comparison.

3. **Cognito flows** — JWT verification (RS256, JWKS TTL), callback URL hygiene,
   password policy. Lambda@Edge inline code's hardcoded user-pool/client IDs
   must match the runtime user pool (CDK outputs `UserPoolId` / `UserPoolClientId`
   for drift detection — see ADR-0003).

4. **Input validation** — Pydantic models on every route, Cypher parameterization
   (no f-string interpolation of user input), AOSS query DSL never built by string concatenation.

5. **Network posture** — ALB SG locked to CloudFront prefix list, Neptune in private
   subnets, AOSS data-policy restricted to API task role.

6. **Demo-vs-production gaps** — anything in SECURITY.md flagged as "demo posture"
   should be mentioned in any audit report so the reader knows the migration plan.

## Output format

Report each finding using this exact shape:

```
### [SEVERITY] Title (one line, action-oriented)

- File: path/to/file.ext:line
- Current state: <what is in place now, one sentence>
- Desired state: <what should be in place, one sentence>
- Migration step: <one concrete change to apply, one sentence>
```

Severity levels:
- **Critical** — active exposure (leaked secret, open IAM `*`, missing JWT verification)
- **High** — clear gap with no defense in depth (broad role, missing auth on a route)
- **Medium** — hardening opportunity that should land before production
- **Low** — defense-in-depth nice-to-have, low operational priority

Group findings by severity (Critical → Low). Skip severities with zero findings.

If no findings at Medium+ severity, end with exactly:
`No findings at Medium+ severity. SECURITY.md demo trade-offs reviewed and consistent.`
